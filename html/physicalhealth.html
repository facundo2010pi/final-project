				<h2>Breakfast is key</h2>
				<li>Breakfast should be one of your three healthy balanced meals in a day; different cultures choose to eat many different things for breakfast so there are many options including a sandwich or chapatti, wholegrain cereals, pancakes, rice or noodles, fruit or even soup. Breakfast will keep your blood sugar level steady until lunchtime and get your brain ready for learning.</li>
				<h2>Portion!</h2><li>Try to have at least one portion of fruit or veg at every meal. One portion is equal to a handful. Remember fruit contains carbohydrate, so space it out through the day, and try to avoid too much fruit juice as this will raise your blood sugar levels quickly. Why not add some salad to your sandwich? Or a pot of fruit salad to your lunch box? You can also throw some extra vegetables into your pasta sauce at dinner time.</li>
				<h2>Don’t forget about calcium</h2>
	            <li>One small pot of yogurt, a small matchbox sized piece of cheese and a 200ml glass of milk (dairy free alternatives are fine) will help keep your teeth and bones in tip top shape.
	            </li><h2>Change is good</h2>
				<li>Why not have some fish instead of meat for a change? It’s good for your brain and low in fat. Tuna makes a good sandwich or jacket potato filling.</li>
