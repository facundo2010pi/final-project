			<p>Mental health is a state of wellbeing. Good mental health means:
				<ul>
					<li>feeling well</li>
					<li>recognising your abilities</li>
					<li>being able to handle life's usual stresses</li>
					<li>being productive</li>
				</ul>
			When young people have poor mental health, it can be harder for them to live happy and successful lives.

Lots of teenagers and young people struggle with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety and self-medicate with drugs and alcohol. Around 1 in every 2 adult mental health disorders start before the age of 14 years.</p>
			<h1 id="differenth1">KEY FACTS</h1>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 15% of the global burden of disease in this age group.</li>
				<li>Depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.</li>
				<li>Suicide  is the third leading cause of death among those aged 15â€“29 years old.</li>
